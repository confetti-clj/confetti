   These two options are very similar `file-maps` takes file-maps as EDN data
   whereas `file-maps-path` loads this EDN data from a file in the fileset.

   In both cases the EDN data should be a sequence of maps containing at least an
   `:s3-key` and `:file` key. Optionally these maps may contain a `:metadata` key.
   The `:file` key can be a path pointing to a file in the fileset (no leading /)
   or a path pointing to any other file on your filesystem (with leading /).

   Other options:
   - `dry-run` will cause all S3 related side effects to be skipped
